ReadMe for source-file:

* main.py

Notes:

* This source code file is executable in itself. It will download, read in, and analyze the dataset, and will generate the accompanying files "Histogram_plots.pdf", "Descriptive_Statistics.csv", and Clustering_Results.csv" as a product of the script.
* "Histogram_plots.pdf" contains the histogram plots of columns A2 - A10, from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
	* https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancerwisconsin.data
* "Descriptive_Statistics.csv" contains information on the mean, median, standard deviation, and variance of each column in the dataset.
* "Clustering_Results.csv" contains the results of the k-means cluster-analysis. For convenience, I exported the content of this file to a pdf of the same name.

Results of analysis:

* The results of this analysis can be found in Final_Report.pdf, a summary document containing a write-up of the project, the source-code, and the exploratory plots. One minor flaw in this report shows up in the docstrings for the function definitions of the source code. Some of the spacing appears to be inexplicably offset. It is recommended that anyone wishing to reproduce this project use the main.py source code file instead of the code in the file.
